# An online shop with shopping card
This is the most complex JavaScript problem I've solved so far  
Here are some of the challenges i faced:
- Take the JSON data from extrnal source (I thought it would be easy) and parse it into an object
- Create the pruchase buttons for each item
- Creating the quantity increase/decrease buttons and functionality. Working with svg icons helped me learn a lot of stuff about their behaviour. It took me a lot of effort hovering these svg icons.
- Creating the shopping cart and updating the product quantity and the total price after adding/removing a product. Even when i was ready, I found out that there was still a bug in this functionality, which i fixed.
- The CSS, of course. The behaviour of the confirmation window is still undesired when the window becomes too tall (purchase more products)
