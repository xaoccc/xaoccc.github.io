Here is a screenshot of my first solution. As you can see, I used the online compiler of programiz.com. 

### Built with 

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

```css
#content-box {
  	margin: 15% 33% 0% 33%;
  	overflow: hidden;
}
#item-description {
	display: table-row;
  }
h4{
  	letter-spacing: 2px;
}
```

And much more CSS features
