Here is a screenshot of my first solution. As you can see, I used the online compiler of programiz.com. 

### Built with 

- HTML5 
- CSS3

### What I learned

#### HTML
Proper use of elements:
- All webpage content must be inside 'header', 'main', 'aside' and 'footed' elements.
- Every page should have a 'h1', but no more than one 'h1' 
- Components cannot have 'h1', they should have 'h2', 'h3', etc.
- 'section' and 'article' are used in very specific cases. Should use 'div' instead.
- 'img' should always have 'alt' attribute, and it should be meaningful, descriptive, not too short, not too long.
- 'alt' for icons contains no description, but the 'alt' is not omitted.

todo..
#### CSS..
